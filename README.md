# MetalStorm-Scrapping-Project
A Python web scrapping project of metalstorm.net

## Motivation
As a metal head I like metal music especially extreme metal: death metal, black metal etc. With some data we can dig into the genre and understand the trends from data perspective. 

This is my personal scrapping project which extracts metal bands infos from metalstorm.net.
